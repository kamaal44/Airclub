This Python application lets pilots and instructors view their logged flights.
A user can log in with their email and password, which are checked in the database.
If the user is recognized as a pilot, they are permitted to view their own flights.
If they are an instructor, they can add flights, remove flights and view all users'
flights recorded in the database.

I made this app to learn the basics of SQL and Python.
I used multiple tables, foreign keys, triggers and views.

Enjoy.
